        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <article class="Prep">
          <h3>Step 1: Prepare shrimp</h3>
          <p class="step">Assuming you're starting with peeled, deveined shrimp (20 pieces), cut each shrimp in half lengthwise. This will help result in a more beautiful, crunchy fry. <br>
          In a bowl, mix salt (0.25 tsp) with the shrimp.
          </p> <br>
          <h3 >Step 2: Prepare sauce</h3>
          <p class="step">
            In a bowl, we'll mix mayonnaise (4 tbsp), sweetened condensed milk (3 tbsp), and lemon juice (2 tsp).
          </p> <br>
          <h3>Step 3: Prepare batter</h3>
          <p class="step">
            In a bowl, we'll beat our egg(s) (0.50). <br>
            In another bowl, we'll mix all purpose flour (4 tbsp), cornstarch (2 tbsp), baking powder (2 tsp), corn oil (2 tsp), water (7 tbsp)​, and the portion of eggs (0.50) that we need.<br>
            We'll mix until the consistency is smooth. You may need to add dashes of water to get it to the consistency that you want.
          </p> <br>
          <h3>Step 4: Heat oil, fry walnuts</h3>
          <p class="step">We'll fill a pan or wok with enough oil to submerge the walnuts, and heat it to around 300F.<br>
          Then, we'll fry our walnuts (3 oz)​ twice, once to cook them, a second time to make them crunchier.</p>
          <ol class="step">
            <li>Fry for 3-4 minutes. Scoop the walnuts out with a strainer ladle, and let the oil reheat to 300F.</li>
            <li>Mix the walnuts with the honey (2 tbsp) (or sugar syrup). Fry for about 2 minutes. Scoop out the walnuts.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="step">
            If you can, you'll want to monitor the temperature of the oil. We don't want to let the walnuts cook in oil that's too hot, otherwise they'll burn.
          </p> <br>
          <h3>Step 5: Heat oil, fry shrimp</h3>
          <p class="step">
            <strong>Read before you start frying shrimp</strong><br>
            Ideally, for frying the shrimp, you'll want to use another pan or wok, or clean the pan/wok you were using before frying.<br>
            If you stick with the same container, there will be some charred honey/sugar at the bottom, which will stick onto the shrimp and result in more muddied look after frying.<br>
            If you're using a second pan/wok, carefully pour some of the oil from the first pan/wok into the second one, being sure not to let any of the honey/sugar pour in.<br><br>
            <strong>How to tell if the oil is hot enough</strong><br>
            When you drop the batter into the oil, if it floats immediately, then the oil is hot enough. If the batter instantly turns golden brown, the oil is actually too hot. <br><br>
            <strong>Start frying shrimp, #1 (cooking)</strong> </p>
            <ul class="step" >
              <li>While we wait for the oil to heat to 350F, we'll mix the batter well. Then, we'll mix the shrimp with the batter.</li>
              <li>Once the oil is hot enough, one by one, carefully set the shrimp into the wok.</li>
              <li>Let the shrimp fry for about 2-3 minutes, until the batter turns a beautiful golden brown.</li>
              <li>Depending on the amount of shrimp you have, you can start transferring out the shrimp that went in first, as the later ones continue to cook.</li>
            </ul> <br>
            <strong>Start frying shrimp, #2 (crunch)</strong>
            <ul class="step">
              <li>This time, the oil should be hotter, around 375-400F.</li>
              <li>Once the oil is hot enough, we'll carefully transfer the shrimp in to the oil.</li>
              <li>Let the shrimp cook for about 60-90 seconds, and transfer them out of the wok into a bowl</li>
            </ul> <br>
            <h3>Step 6: Plate and garnish</h3>
            <p class="step">
              Mix and coat the shrimp with the sauce from earlier, and add the candied walnuts and sesame seeds. <br>
              Time to eat!
